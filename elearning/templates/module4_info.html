 <h2>Secure Payments</h2>
</div>
   
    <p>
      Secure payment practices help protect both individuals and organisations
      from fraud, scams, and financial loss. Attackers often target online payments
      by stealing card details, redirecting transactions, or tricking people into
      approving fraudulent payments. Understanding how to verify payment requests
      and protect financial information is essential in any workplace.
    </p>

    <h3 class="module-subtitle">Verify Payment Requests</h3>
    <p>
      Always confirm the source of a payment request before taking action.
      Criminals may impersonate managers, suppliers, or finance teams and ask
      for urgent payments or changes to bank details. Never rely on email alone
      always double-check through an approved communication channel such as a
      phone call or internal system.
    </p>

    <h3 class="module-subtitle">Use Trusted Payment Platforms</h3>
    <p>
      Payments should only be made through verified and trusted systems. Avoid
      entering financial information on unfamiliar websites or platforms that lack
      security indicators such as HTTPS. Unsecured or unofficial sites increase the
      risk of card theft or unauthorised access.
    </p>

    <h3 class="module-subtitle">Watch for Refund and Invoice Scams</h3>
    <p>
      Attackers often send fake invoices or issue false refund notices to trick users
      into submitting card details or confirming payments. Unexpected invoices,
      duplicate requests, or unrecognised vendors should always be reported or
      checked with your finance department.
    </p>

    <h3 class="module-subtitle">Card Security</h3>
    <p>
      Card details including full number, expiry date, and CVV must never be
      shared over email, messaging apps, or plain text. These details should only be
      entered into secure, approved systems. Even images or screenshots of card
      details can be enough for attackers to commit fraud.
    </p>
