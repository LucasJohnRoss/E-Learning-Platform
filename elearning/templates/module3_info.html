  <h2>Password Safety</h2>
</div>

    <p>
      Password safety is one of the most important parts of protecting your personal
      and work accounts. Weak or reused passwords allow attackers to break into
      systems, access sensitive data, and impersonate users. Strong password habits
      dramatically reduce the risk of a security breach.
    </p>

    <h3 class="module-subtitle">Create Strong Passwords</h3>
    <p>
      A strong password is long, unique, and difficult to guess. Avoid using personal
      information such as birthdays, names, or common words. Instead, use a mix of
      letters, numbers, and symbols. Many organisations also encourage using 
      passphrases. Longer combinations of random words that are easier to remember 
      but extremely difficult to crack.
    </p>

    <h3 class="module-subtitle">Avoid Reusing Passwords</h3>
    <p>
      Reusing the same password across multiple accounts is dangerous. If one service
      becomes compromised, attackers often try the same password on other platforms
      using a technique known as credential stuffing. Every account should have a 
      different password to prevent one breach from turning into many.
    </p>

    <h3 class="module-subtitle">Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h3>
    <p>
      MFA adds an additional layer of security by requiring something you know 
      (your password) and something you have (a code sent to your phone or an 
      authentication app). Even if someone discovers your password, they will not be 
      able to log in without the second factor.
    </p>

    <h3 class="module-subtitle">Never Share Your Passwords</h3>
    <p>
      Passwords are personal and must never be shared — not with colleagues, friends,
      or even IT staff. Legitimate support teams will never ask for your password.
      Sharing passwords makes it impossible to track who accessed what, increases 
      the risk of mistakes, and can expose sensitive data.
    </p>

    <h3 class="module-subtitle">Recognise Password Scams</h3>
    <p>
      Attackers may pretend to be IT support, your manager, or a trusted service to
      trick you into revealing your password. Be cautious of unexpected messages
      asking you to “verify your account,” “unlock your access,” or “reset your
      password” through unfamiliar links.
    </p>

    <h3 class="module-subtitle">How to Keep Your Passwords Safe</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a unique password for every account.</li>
      <li>Create long, complex passwords or passphrases.</li>
      <li>Enable Multi-Factor Authentication whenever possible.</li>
      <li>Never write passwords on sticky notes or share them with anyone.</li>
      <li>Report suspicious password-related messages to IT immediately.</li>
    </ul>
