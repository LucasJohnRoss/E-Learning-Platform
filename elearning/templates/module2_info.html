 <h2>Malware</h2>
</div>
   


    <p>
      Malware (malicious software) is any software that is designed to damage, disrupt,
      or gain unauthorised access to a system, device, or network. It can be installed
      through unsafe downloads, malicious email attachments, infected websites, or
      compromised USB drives. Understanding the main types of malware helps you
      recognise how they behave and how to defend against them.
    </p>

    <h3 class="module-subtitle"> Viruses</h3>
    <p>
      A virus attaches itself to legitimate files or programs and spreads when those
      files are opened or shared. Once active, it can corrupt data, slow systems down,
      or spread to other machines on the network.
    </p>

    <h3 class="module-subtitle">Trojans</h3>
    <p>
      A trojan disguises itself as a legitimate program, such as a “free” tool or update.
      When the user runs it, it can create backdoors, steal data, or install additional
      malicious software in the background.
    </p>

    <h3 class="module-subtitle">Ransomware</h3>
    <p>
      Ransomware encrypts files or locks devices and then demands payment to restore
      access. It can stop a business from operating by blocking access to critical data
      and systems, even if only one user is initially infected.
    </p>

    <h3 class="module-subtitle">Adware</h3>
    <p>
      Adware displays unwanted adverts, pop-ups, or redirects your browser to specific
      sites. While some adware is simply annoying, it can also track browsing activity
      or be used to deliver more serious malware.
    </p>

    <h3 class="module-subtitle">How to Avoid Malware</h3>
    <p>
      To reduce the risk of malware, only download software from trusted sources, keep
      your operating system and applications up to date, and never open unexpected
      attachments or links from unknown senders. Use approved security tools provided
      by your organisation, and report any suspicious activity or unusual pop-ups to IT
      immediately.
